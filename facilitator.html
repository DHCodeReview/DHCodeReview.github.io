<h2>Review Facilitators</h2>

<p>
    Review facilitators play an important role in our review process. Facilitators organize meetings, set up code for review, and lead kick-off and recap meetings. Facilitating reviews does not require any technical expertise, just some organizational skills. It is an easy way to get involved with our community code review work.

     If you are interested in becoming a facilitator, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/GPzv3wzuB5WXq24V9">this form</a>. We will get in touch with you about how to get started. Before you facilitate a review yourself, you will "shadow" another facilitator first, to see our process in action. Once you are ready, you will facilitate a review yourself. We have templates and checklists to help you along the way. It's low effort but a really important job! You'll be recognized as a facilitator on our website afterwards and will have everyone's deep gratitude.
