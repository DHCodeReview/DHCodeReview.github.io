2024 was a busy year for the Code Review Working Group! We completed [four reviews](/recent-reviews.html), switched to quarterly submission deadlines, and presented our work at DHTech's mini-conference ["DH Inside Out" at DH2024](https://dh-tech.github.io/blog/2024/06/14/dh-inside-out-dh2024-program/).


We plan 2025 to be just as exciting and succesful but we need your help! Do you have code that could benefit from being reviewed? Maybe you plan on writing a paper about it but want to make sure there are no bugs in the code you might have missed? Or maybe you would like a second opinion on how you architected your code? Or maybe you are still learning and are wondering if you approach is right! All of these motivations (and more!) are valid reasons to submit your code for review. Your code does not have to be finished and polished. Take a look at our [submission page](submit-code.html) and submit your code for review!

If you don't have any code at the moment you would like to have reviewed but would like to get involved, you can also sign up to be a facilitator. Facilitators organize the code review process by organizing meetings and getting everyone on the same page. It’s low effort but a really important job! You’ll be recognized as a facilitator on our website afterwards and will have everyone’s deep gratitude. You can sign up using our [facilitator application form](https://forms.gle/GPzv3wzuB5WXq24V9).
