<h2>What code can be reviewed?</h2>
<p>
Code reviews can be pretty time consuming. When requesting a review, please only submit requests for code that can be understood and reviewed in roughly an hour. This means, at this point, we can't accept requests for extensive libraries and whole desktop or web applications.
</p>

<h2>General requirements</h2>
<p>
To effectively review your code, please make sure the following conditions are met:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your repository is publicly available.</li>
    <li>There is a LICENSE file in the repository.</li>
    <li>Documentation is available and clearly accessible (e.g. a README file in the repository).
        <ul>
            <li>The documentation contains installation instructions.</li>
            <li>The documentation contains a description of what problem the code solves and its functionality.            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Example data is available.</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
    Especially if you are submitting code in progress, we understand that the above requirements might not be met. <b>Please submit your code anyways</b> and make a note in your submission that you could not meet the requirements. We will take a look and let you know if there is anything we believe is needed to effectively review your code. 
</div>

<h2>How to submit a review request?</h2>
<p>
When getting ready to submit code for a review, please make sure to have the following information available (you will need them for the submission form):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Link to the GitHub repository that contains the code to be reviewed. Ideally the repository would only contain the code that should be reviewed. If, however, there is more code that shouldn't be reviewed please note so in the form.
What is the utilized programming language?</li>
    <li>Who are the authors and contributors and what did they contribute? What are the roles of the submitters?</li>
    <li>Are there supporting papers (that, for example, describe employed algorithms)?</li>
    <li>For which field was the code developed?</li>
    <li>Are there any standards the reviewer should know? Is there any other domain knowledge required?</li>
    <li>Are there any requirements that need to be fulfilled for the code to run (e.g. hardware requirements, OS requirements, etc)?</li>
    <li>Anything else we need to know?</li>
</ul>
